blueprint:
  name: Unlock Door Before Event (Parallel + Trim + Cancel Check)
  description: >
    Unlocks a door a specified duration before an event starts.
    
    SAFEGUARDS:
    1. Checks for 'canceled' in the title (won't unlock).
    2. Trims whitespace from keywords (fixes the space error).
    3. Runs in PARALLEL mode to ensure no events are missed.
    4. ONLY unlocks if the keyword matches (empty keyword = no unlock).
