blueprint:
  name: Periodic Door Unlock Fail-Safe (Unlock Only)
  description: >
    Periodically checks the selected calendar for an active event that contains the door keyword
    (stored in an input_text helper) and does NOT contain a cancellation keyword.
    If such an active event is detected and the door (specified by the door lock entity)
    is locked, the automation unlocks the door by setting the door lock rule to "keep_unlock"
    and sends a notification to a selected mobile device.
